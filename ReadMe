This program is designed to help people see how sorting algorithms are working visually


To run this program, just run the main driver class.. SortVisualizer.java, and you can edit the array's size in that file, as well as animation speed, order of sorting algorithms, etc....

Currently has 8 sorting algorithms...
1. Heap Sort
2. Quick Sort
3. Bubble Sort
4. Insertion Sort
5. Merge Sort
6. Selection Sort
7. Tree Sort
8. Bogo Sort (Ok this one doesn't really count though)
